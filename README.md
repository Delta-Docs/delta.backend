## Overview

Delta is a continuous documentation platform that treats documentation as a living part of your codebase, automatically detecting and preventing drift. By integrating directly with your CI/CD pipeline, it analyses every Pull Request to ensure documentation, whether it be API references, setup guides, etc. remain perfectly synchronised with your evolving code - effectively linting your documentation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker
- Git
- GitHub App Credentials

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Delta-Docs/delta.backend.git
   cd delta.backend
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables** (`.env`)
   ```env
   # Database
   POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres"

   # Auth
   SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
   ALGORITHM="ALGORITHM_USED"
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7

   # GitHub App
   GITHUB_APP_ID="YOUR_GITHUB_APP_ID"
   GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="path/to/private-key.pem"
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"
   GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="YOUR_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET"

   # RQ Config
   REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
   NUM_WORKERS=2

   FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"

   REPOS_BASE_PATH="/path/to/delta.backend/repos"
   ```

4. **Run setup command**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   This will:
   - Create a Python Virtual Environment (at `.venv`)
   - Install all `pip` dependencies
   - Start Docker containers
   - Run database migrations

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

   The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Install pip dependencies only
make install

# Start Docker services
make docker-up

# Stop Docker services
make docker-down

# Run development server (with reload)
make dev

# Run production server
make run

# Create a new migration
make migrate msg="your migration message"

# Apply migrations
make up

# Rollback all migrations
make down

# Clean cache files
make clean
```

> **NOTE**: The `make` commands are designed to work only on Linux.  
> If you are using another OS, please check the Makefile and execute the corresponding commands directly.



## Architecture

![Delta Architecture](/images/Delta_Architecture_Diagram.png)

### The Web Dashboard 

It allows the user to interact and set up Delta. It is a React + Vite application that allows the user to:
 - Sign Up and access Delta
 - Link new repositories
 - Manage settings for linked repositories (drift sensitivity, target branch, etc.)

[See delta.frontend code.](https://github.com/Delta-Docs/delta.frontend)

### The GitHub App
The **heart** of the system. On linking a repository, The **Delta-Docs** GitHub App is automatically installed in the repository. It is responsible for 2 things: 
- Primarily, it sets up webhooks for the linked repository.
- All GitHub API calls that access data from a private GitHub repository, require an access token. These access tokens however expire 8 hours after creation (during initial GitHub OAuth). This means we need to renew the access token. Hence, we use the GitHub App's private key to sign a JWT and get a valid access token.

### GitHub Webhook Events
Delta completely relies on GitHub webhook events to operate. Currently, it is set up to track 3 kinds of webhook events:
- `installation`: It is received when the user performs some action related to the installation of the GitHub App. It is triggered with the installation (which also includes the linking of at least 1 repository), uninstallation, suspension or unsuspension of the GitHub App.
- `installation_repository`: It is received when a repository is added or removed from an existing installation.
- `pull_request`: It is received when a pull request is raised in any of the linked repository.

The `github_webhook_service.py` handles the payload from these types of webhook events and updates the DB and starts workflows accordingly.

### Redis Queue and RQ Workers
Upon receiving a `pull_request` webhook event, a record in the `DriftEvent` table is created. Every PR raised has to be analysed. Due to the amount of time processing a PR may take and considering the timeout limits of REST APIs, this analysis and workflow has to be done asynchronously. 

This is the reason we use Redis Queue. It is a simple queue implemented with Redis that has multiple consumers (the RQ Worker Pool). It is simple and complex enough for its purpose here at Delta.

When a `DriftEvent` record is created, its ID is enqueued for processing. Any free RQ worker from the worker pool picks up the id and executes the task assigned with it.

### Multi Agent Workflow
This part of the architecture is still in the design phase and hasn't really been implemented yet, its a work in progress :)

The plan is a 4 agent workflow with `LangGraph` as the orchestrator:
- **The Scouting Agent:** It has direct access to the cloned repository which it uses to extract code changes, relations and code-doc mappings. It updates the DB with its findings.
- **The Analyzer Agent:** It takes the code changes and the code-doc mappings that were output from the previous agent and any other input from the codebase to semantically analyse the changes in code and check if these changes are reflected in the documentation. It also updates the DB with its findings.
- **The Generator Agent:** It receives instructions from the analyzer agent with what parts of the documentation requires updates. Based on the `style_preference` for the repository, it generates updates to the documentation and sends it to the next agent.
- **The Reviewer Agent:** It receives the proposed changes from the generator agent and checks it against instructions from the analyzer agent. If any corrections/changes are required, the generator agent is instructed to implement the fixes. The updates then go back to the reviewer agent and the cycle continues. Once the proposed updates are approved, it is written to the cloned repository, committed via git and a PR is automatically raised (most probably with `gh-cli`) with a request for review.
